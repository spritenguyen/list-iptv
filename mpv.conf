# Example mpv configuration file
#
# Warning:
#
# The commented example options usually do _not_ set the default values. Call
# mpv with --list-options to see the default values for most options. There is
# no builtin or example mpv.conf with all the defaults.
#
#
# Configuration files are read system-wide from /usr/local/etc/mpv.conf
# and per-user from ~/.config/mpv/mpv.conf, where per-user settings override
# system-wide settings, all of which are overridden by the command line.
#
# Configuration file settings and the command line options use the same
# underlying mechanisms. Most options can be put into the configuration file
# by dropping the preceding '--'. See the man page for a complete list of
# options.
#
# Lines starting with '#' are comments and are ignored.
#
# See the CONFIGURATION FILES section in the man page
# for a detailed description of the syntax.
#
# Profiles should be placed at the bottom of the configuration file to ensure
# that settings wanted as defaults are not restricted to specific profiles.

#autofit-larger=90%x90%

# Do not close the window on exit.

# Do not wait with showing the video window until it has loaded. (This will
# resize the window once video is loaded. Also always shows a window with
# audio.)

# Disable the On Screen Controller (OSC).
#osc=no

# Keep the player window on top of all other windows.

# Specify high quality video rendering preset (for --vo=gpu only)
# Can cause performance problems with some drivers and GPUs.
#profile=gpu-hq

# Force video to lock on the display's refresh rate, and change video and audio
# speed to some degree to ensure synchronous playback - can cause problems
# with some drivers and desktop environments.
#video-sync=display-resample

# Enable hardware decoding if available. Often, this does not work with all
# video outputs, but should work well with default settings on most systems.
# If performance or energy usage is an issue, forcing the vdpau or vaapi VOs
# may or may not help.
#hwdec=auto

##################
# audio settings #
##################

# Specify default audio device. You can list devices with: --audio-device=help
# The option takes the device string (the stuff between the '...').
#audio-device=alsa/default

# Do not filter audio to keep pitch when changing playback speed.

# Output 5.1 audio natively, and upmix/downmix audio with a different format.
#audio-channels=5.1
# Disable any automatic remix, _if_ the audio output accepts the audio format.
# of the currently played file. See caveats mentioned in the manpage.
# (The default is "auto-safe", see manpage.)
